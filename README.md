# Javascript Weather Dashboard

This is a basic weather dashboard made with Javascript, HTML, and CSS. The app utilizes the OpenWeather API as well as Moment.js for weather data and time and date.

The main purpose of this project is for practice with Javascript and using third party server side APIs.

## How to Use

The user will type a city into the search bar. After searching, the daily forecast will be displayed, including a weather icon, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and UV index.

The background color of the UV index will change depending on the value.

Underneath that, the upcoming forecast for the next 5 days will be displayed as cards containing similar information. 

All previous searches are displayed in a list on the left and saved to localstorage. When clicking on a previous search, the weather info will be displayed again. If the user clicks the clear history button, all previous search history will be deleted and the buttons removed.
